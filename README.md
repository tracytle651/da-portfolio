# Tracy Le – Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi, I'm Tracy! I’m a recent graduate in Business Analytics & Technology with a concentration in Data Science, currently working as a Business Intelligence Analyst. With a strong academic background and hands-on experience in BI tools, I enjoy helping teams make smarter decisions by turning raw data into clear, actionable insights.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve built a solid foundation in data analytics and ETL tools and worked on a range of projects involving data transformation, dashboard creation, workflow automation, and business analysis. These experiences have allowed me to develop both the technical skills and the strategic mindset needed to deliver insights that support data-driven decision-making across teams.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new data tools, working on personal analytics projects, and diving into open datasets. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, I’m passionate about uncovering patterns in data and communicating them effectively.

My CV is in pdf.

This GitHub repository is a space to showcase my skills, share my projects, and track my growth as a data and business intelligence professional.
